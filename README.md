# Project 1<br>Browser-based Game

## Overview

Your first SEI project will start out with something fun - **a game!**

This is an opportunity to **be creative**, and work through some **tough programming challenges**.

**You will be working individually for this project**, 
but we'll be guiding you along the process and helping as you go. 
Show us what you've got!

> If you want to choose a game different from what is listed for Project #4 please consult with us!
> arning - many seemingly simple games are much more complex than you might think!

As a reminder, GA has a zero tolerance [plagiarism policy](https://git.generalassemb.ly/sei-424-beherenow/class-info#plagiarism) - your project's code **must be substantially yours**. **Do not copy code from similar projects, tutorials, or other sources**.  However, using  lines of code from  StackOverflow to accomplish general techniques/algorithms is okay - an example would be using StackOverflow as a source for code that replaces a character at a certain position in a string. Do not ask ChatGPT to make your game for you ;)

## Planning & Presentation Requirements

### Planning - Due Monday 5/8 @ 9am:

- You will share:

	☐ Your choice of game.

	☐ A wireframe of your "main" game screen.

	☐ Pseudocode for the overall game play.

### Presentation - Friday 5/12 @1pm:

You will have a maximum of 10 minutes to present your project following these guidelines:


1. **Introduce the Project:**

	☐ Intro your game by paraphrasing the README.
	
2. **Demonstrate the Project:**

	☐ Launch the game by clicking the link in the README.
	
	☐ Play the game! If necessary, manipulate the values of variables in the console to ensure a quick win or loss.
	
3. **Show/discuss your code:**

	☐ Briefly show the HTML & CSS. 
	
	☐ Show the JavaScript and discuss your favorite function.

4. **Share the experience:**

	☐ What was your biggest challenge?
	
	☐ What are your key learnings/takeaways?
	
5. **Q & A + Feedback**

## Technical Requirements

### Your App Must:

☐ **Render a game in the browser**.

☐ **Include win/loss logic and render win/loss messages in HTML.** Popup alerts using the `alert()` method are okay during development, but not production.

☐ Include separate HTML, CSS & JavaScript files.

☐ Have **properly indented HTML, CSS & JavaScript**. In addition, vertical whitespace needs to be consistent.

☐ No remaining **unused and/or commented out code** (code that will never be called).

☐ Have meaningful comments explaining what the code is doing, and reasoning for the logic.

☐ Have functions and variables that are named sensibly. Remember, functions are typically named as verbs and variables (data) named as nouns.

☐ **Be coded in a consistent** manner. For example, choose between your preference for function declarations vs. function expressions.

☐ **Be deployed online** using GitHub Pages so that the rest of the world can play your game!

## Necessary Deliverables

We will be using this [evaluation](evaluation.md) guideline to grade your project.

☐ The code for **a working game that meets or exceeds the above technical requirements, built by you, and hosted on GitHub Pages**.

- **A ``README.md`` file** with these sections:

  ☐ **\<Your game's title\>**: A description of your game.  Background info of the game is a nice touch.
  
  ☐ **Screenshot(s):** Images of your actual game.
  
  ☐ **Technologies Used**: List of the technologies used, e.g., JavaScript, HTML, CSS...
  
  ☐ **Getting Started**: In this section include the link to your deployed game and any instructions you deem important. 
  
  ☐ **Next Steps**: Planned future enhancements (icebox items).
  
  > Note: Don't underestimate the value of a well crafted `README.md`. The `README.md` introduces your project to prospective employers and forms their first impression of your work!

☐ **Frequent commits (at least 1 every day) dating back to the very beginning of the project**. Never delete you repo to "start over".  Commit messages should be in the present tense, e.g., "Style game board" instead of "Styled game board". **Be sure to create the repo on your personal GitHub account and ensure that it is "public".**

## Suggestions

- **The BEST advice is to follow the guidelines and principles in the** [Guide to Building a Browser App](https://git.generalassemb.ly/sei-424-beherenow/SEI-NYC-424/blob/main/Unit_1/05-programming/5.1-guide-to-building-a-browser-game.md). The guide will give you a step-by-step process to get you started and its MVC design pattern will result in clearer, more concise code that can scale functionality more easily.
- **Theme your game** to give it a more personal touch and make it more unique!
- **Use your Development Tools** (Chrome DevTools rock!) to debug and solve issues.
- Keep it simple. Minimum Viable Product (MVP) functionality that looks great is better than extra functionality added to a game without polish.
- If you choose a card-based game, there is a CSS library in the _resources_ directory of the class repo that will help you render **beautiful** cards of any size, front and back.
- Review and check regularly the [Project 1 Code Review](./project-1-code-review.pdf) to ensure that your project is going to meet the minimum requirements.
- **Consult documentation and other resources** to better understand methods, etc.
- Write **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** code. Check for repeating code and refactor into functions that accept arguments.
