<h1>Expected Inflation</h1>


<p>
    Inflation is an economic concept that refers to the sustained increase in the general price level of goods and services in an economy over time. It is typically measured by calculating the percentage change in a price index, such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which tracks the average prices of a basket of goods and services commonly consumed by households. Inflation erodes the purchasing power of money, as it requires more currency to buy the same amount of goods and services.

<p>
    Over the last 50 years in the United States, the average inflation rate has been around 3.6%. This average rate takes into account fluctuations in inflation, which can be influenced by various factors such as changes in supply and demand, government fiscal policies, monetary policies, and global economic conditions. It is important to note that inflation rates can vary significantly from year to year and can have a significant impact on the overall economy, including wages, investments, and the cost of living.
