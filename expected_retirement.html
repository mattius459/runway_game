<h1>Expected Retirement</h1>

<p>
    Social Security is a government program in the United States that provides financial assistance to eligible individuals and families, primarily in the form of retirement income. It was established in 1935 as a response to the economic hardships faced by older Americans during the Great Depression. Social Security operates as a pay-as-you-go system, where current workers contribute a portion of their wages to support current retirees, with the expectation that they will receive benefits when they retire.
</p>
<p>
    The age at which individuals can begin drawing Social Security benefits depends on their birth year. The full retirement age, which is the age at which individuals can receive their full Social Security benefits, ranges from 66 to 67 years, depending on the year of birth. However, individuals can choose to start receiving reduced benefits as early as age 62. Keep in mind that opting for early retirement will result in lower monthly benefit amounts compared to waiting until the full retirement age. On the other hand, delaying retirement beyond the full retirement age can lead to increased benefits through delayed retirement credits.
</p>
<p>
    The average age at which Americans generally begin drawing Social Security benefits is around 64-65 years. However, the choice of when to start receiving benefits is a personal decision influenced by various factors such as individual financial needs, health status, and anticipated longevity. It's important for individuals to consider their specific circumstances and evaluate the trade-offs between early retirement with reduced benefits and waiting to receive higher monthly benefits.
