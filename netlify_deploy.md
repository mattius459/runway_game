### We have an account! We can now deploy our sites one of two ways!

#### Method one: automatically deploying your project by linking your github repo

1. If we select "Import from Git", it will ask you to "Pick a repository from GitHub"
2. After you click on the repo your project is in that you want to deploy, follow these steps
  - Choose the owner(you!)
  - Pick which branch you want to deploy (just choose either the main or master for now, basically wherever you've been working in).
  - Leave the remaining fields blank for default parameters, and deploy!
3. Give Netlify a few minutes to deploy your site, and refresh your browser window.
4. You should have a clickable link and a randomly generated name.

5. Change your site's name by clicking on "Site Settings", the clicking on "Change Site Name", add your new name and click "Save".

6. You now have a deployed website!!!


#### Method two: Drag and drop/browse to upload!

1. Either find the folder that has your project's code on your desktop in finder(mac) or file explorer(windows), and drag it to the section below. Or browse through your computer to find the folder and select it.

2. Follow from step 3 above!


### Netlify is totally free! But if you really like it, you can upgrade for some bells and whistles. We will NOT need to do so during this cohort.


### Bonus: [Installing netlify and running it from the CLI](https://docs.netlify.com/cli/get-started/)
1. Coming soon (we don't have node installed yet!)
