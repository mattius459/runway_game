<h1>Expected Return</h1>

<p>
    Life expectancy refers to the average number of years a person is expected to live based on various factors such as their birth year, gender, socioeconomic status, and overall health. It is influenced by a combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. While genetics play a role in determining life expectancy, lifestyle choices such as diet, exercise, smoking habits, and access to healthcare can have a significant impact on overall health and longevity. Socioeconomic factors, including income level, education, and access to resources and healthcare facilities, also contribute to differences in life expectancy among populations.
</p>
<p>
    In the United States, the average life expectancy has been steadily increasing over the years. As of the latest available data, the average life expectancy in the USA is around 78.8 years. However, it's important to note that life expectancy can vary among different demographic groups and regions within the country. Factors such as racial and ethnic disparities, income inequality, and healthcare access contribute to these variations.
