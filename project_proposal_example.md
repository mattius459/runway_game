- Personal Finance Trivia

## Project Description

My app is called "Runway". It is an app for those aspiring to get a better hold on their own personal finances in a way that is personalized, engaging, and informative. In a nutshell, it allows users to input information pertaining to their own financial situation and it computes a "personal financial runway" for them which calculates when they might be able to retire.

## User Stories

#### MVP Goals

- App allows user to input age, monthly income, monthly spending, and current investments and the app returns a graph for their own runway.
- In an expandable "advanced configurations" section, users are allowed to adjust many of the default variables.
- Advanced configs include Expected return on investment accounts, Expected Inflation rate, Expected age to begin drawing from social security, and Life Expectency.
- In order to unlock the ability to change each of these each of these advanced configs, users must read information about what that particular config does, and then answer a multiple choice question about it.
- Once that is done, the feature is unlocked and the user is awarded some "points" as well.
- Points will be displayed in the top right of the main screen.
- The "unlocking" ability will be made apparent when the user clicks a tooltip next to each advanced config.
- Use media queries to make the app responsive.

#### Stretch Goals

- Add in additional advanced configs and the corresponding educational material.
- Make input fields turn into sliders once the user has inputted for the first time.
- Make so that when user moves sliders, the chart dynamically changes.
- Make it more polished looking using various CSS styling.
